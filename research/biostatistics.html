<p class="margin1" style="color: blue;">I am interested in applications of statistics to:</p> 
    <ul class="margin2" style="color: blue;">
        <li>Epidemiology</li>
        <li>Biostatistics</li>
        <li>Genomics</li>
    </ul>

<p class="margin1" style="color:blueviolet ;">   
    Now, I would love to research real-life applications
     of Mathematics and Statistics in health sciences. I focus more on the fields of:
     <ul class="margin2" style="color:blueviolet;">
        <li>Disease Mapping</li>
        <li>Survival Analysis</li>
        <li>Spatial-Temporal Analysis/Survival Analysis</li>
        <li>Study Design</li>
        <li>Multi-Omics with or without Longitudinal Analysis</li>
        <li>Applications of Machine Learning/Neural Network to Health Science</li>
    </ul>

<p class="margin1" style="color: chocolate;"> Current projects I am working on:</p>
    <ol class="margin2" style="color: blue;" class="margin2">
        <li>Spatial-Temporal Analysis/Survival Analysis: In survival analysis for a disease, 
            we counted the time a person had an event, and then we analyze the data. Notice that
             censor, patients dropped the study,  is the main issue that survival analysis is 
             different from linear regression. In the longitudinal analysis, we analyze the 
             outcome based on what was happening during the time course for the outcomes. 
             When we combine both survival and longitudinal analysis, we have a model called 
             joint longitudinal survival analysis. In those models, they could capture what 
             happened and the survival time of patients according to the changes in their body 
             reactions. <br>
            So, why would I like to study Spatial-temporal survival analysis? One of the reasons 
            is the health determinant factors in each location will affect the health of each 
            patient. For example, people living in polluted areas by oil refined regions will 
            have different survival time from ones living in a clean environment for cancer 
            patients. And people living near that contaminated area may have related outcomes. 
            Our models will be able to capture those factors.

        </li>
        <li>Does increasing continuity of care protect patients with chronic diseases from 
            Emergency visits or hospitalizations? In this project, we would like to answer 
            the question by analyzing the data of patients living in Hinds county and its 
            neighbors of Mississippi by applying Spatial-temporal analysis.
        </li>
        <li>Neural Networks in Health Science: Neuron Network or Convolution Neuron Network 
            works very well in image classification. Some studies used successfully Neural 
            Network in predicting Alzheimer's diseases from MRI images of patients in which 
            they could outpace human predictions by six months. Can we build models that join 
            Neural Network techniques and patients' medical records to get better results for 
            predictions and also for preventions?

var text1= '<p style="color: blue"> Abstract:</p>' +
'<p style="color: blue"> Background: Obesity affects nearly half of U.S. adults and is contributing substantially to an epidemic of obesity-associated chronic conditions (OCC) such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and arthritis. The OCC epidemic is particularly severe in low-income, medically underserved, predominantly African American areas in the southern U.S. “obesity belt”. Little is known regarding the impact of geographic, income, and racial disparities in continuity on major health outcomes for patients with OCC. </p>'+
'<p style="color: blue"> Objectives: To assess among patents with OCC and the subgroup with T2D: (1) whether continuity of care is associated with lower overall and potentially preventable emergency department (ED) and hospital utilization, (2) the effect of geographic, income, and racial disparities on continuity and healthcare utilizations (3) whether continuity particularly protects individuals at risk for disparities from adverse health outcomes, and (4) whether the characteristics of health systems  are associated with higher continuity and better outcomes. </p>' +
'<p style="color: blue"> Methods: Using 2015-2018 data from four practice-based research networks (PBRN) participating in the Southern Obesity and Diabetes Coalition, we will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis and distributed meta-analysis. OCC patients and the T2D subgroup will be assessed within each health system following a standardized study protocol. The protocol manuscript was prepared in accordance with cohort studies checklist set by the STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) version 4. The primary study outcomes are overall and preventable ED visits and hospitalizations. Continuity of care will be calculated at the facility level using a modified version of the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index. Race will be assessed using EMR data. Residence in a low-income area or a health professional shortage area (HPSA) respectively will be assessed by linking patient residence ZIP Codes to the CMS database.    </p>'+
'<p style="color: blue"> Results: Four regional health systems across Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas including a total of 53 adult hospitals participated in the study. A total of 147,889 OCC patients were identified in these health systems who met full study criteria, of which 45,453 patients met criteria for inclusion in the T2D subgroup. Results are expected by the end of 2020. </p>' +
'<p style="color: blue"> Conclusion: This study should reveal whether health system efforts to increase continuity of care for patients with obesity and diabetes have potential to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Analyzing disparities in continuity of care and their effect on major health outcomes can help demonstrate how to improve care and use of healthcare resources for vulnerable patients with OCC and subgroup patients with T2D. The study will help generate hypotheses regarding the health system characteristics associated with highest continuity and best outcomes. Better understanding of the association between continuity and healthcare utilization for these vulnerable populations will contribute to the development of higher-value health systems in the Southern U.S."</p>'

'<p style="color: blue"> Background: As of 30 August 2020, the U.S. has been struggling with a large number of new cases daily of pandemic COVID19 since the first confirmed cases in February. Many Northern states had so many confirmed cases due to their population density and commuting in major cities. As a result, many people died because of COVID19 in those states. Mississippi, a state in the South of the United States with low population density as well as low travelers, has become one of the most states with the highest numbers of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. Comparing to its neighbors, Mississippi had a significantly higher in both numbers of cases and deaths than others. Why was Mississippi so different from others that were almost similar in every factor?</p>'+
'<p style="color: blue"> Methods: In this COVID19 study, we used the data of numbers of cases and deaths daily from March 10 to August 10 in Mississippi to study geographic, economic, education, and uninsured rate effects on the increase of confirmed cases and deaths in Mississippi. The outcomes are the numbers of COVID cases and deaths calculated with the geography of counties, income, education, population density, unemployment rate, and uninsured rate of adults living under the 400% poverty level. We applied a Bayesian spatial-temporal regression method to find out which factors significantly affected the cases and deaths in Mississippi.</p>'+
'<p style="color: blue"> Results: In Mississippi, we found that besides counties having more people would have more COVID19 cases, Black people and uninsured people had a much higher risk of getting COVID19 than White people and insured people. Moreover, for each county, uninsured people were more vulnerable to deaths because of COVID10 than others, added the fact that more infected cases would drive more deaths.</p>' +
'<p style="color: blue"> Conclusion: Mississippi had a significantly larger number of cases and deaths per one million population than its neighbors because of its high percentage of Black people and uninsured rate."</p>'
