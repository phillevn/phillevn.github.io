                        <p> We developed a novel ensemble method that invokes a Group Lasso Model with a permutation-assisted (PA) technique to find the feature associated with clinical outcomes of interest. Our model got high accuracy and less irrelevant selected features through various simulation scenarios due to the PA method. When using our selected features for the prediction model, our results showed better performance and robust predictions across different prediction models.</p>

                        <p> Predicting the binding of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to peptides is essential for understanding the immune system and developing new immunotherapy treatments for diseases such as cancer. To achieve this, we developed various models using Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks to encode letter-based amino acid sequences of TCRs into numerical values, which increases data variation. Additionally, we built a Bayesian classification model to obtain a high-performance model that can check the probability of binding between TCRs and a list of antigen peptides and provide uncertainty levels of predictions.</p>

                        <p>In our cohort study conducted in Mississippi, we examined whether increasing continuity of care provided protection to patients with chronic diseases against emergency visits and hospitalization readmissions. To investigate this, we employed spatial-temporal models that took into account the influence of geographic locations on the risk of experiencing emergency visits and hospitalizations. Notably, our approach diverged from classical linear regressions by incorporating the correlation effects of the neighborhood, which arise from Social Determinants of Health factors. This allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of the data and yielded insights into the potential benefits of improved continuity of care for patients with chronic diseases.</p>

                        <p>In this retrospective cohort survival study, we used the Cox proportional hazard model to investigate if undergoing surgery for non-related cancer issues would increase the lifespan of patients. In addition to our primary model, which was adjusted for age, race, and gender, we also conducted univariate models for age, gender, race, and surgery status, as well as a model for the interaction of surgery status and age. Our results showed that males had a 3% higher risk of death compared to females. Regarding race, the median survival times were 24 months for Asian/Pacific Islanders, 16 months for White individuals, 13 months for Black individuals, and the lowest at 12 months for American Indian/Native Alaskan individuals. We found conclusive evidence that surgery positively impacted patients' lifespans. Patients who underwent surgery had a median survival time of 36 months, while those who did not undergo surgery and were not recommended for surgery had median survival times of 11 months and 7 months, respectively. </p>
