<p>I am interested in applications of statistics to Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Genomics. 
    In the past, my hobbies were studying mathematics in the field of Partial Differential 
    Equations and Geometric Measure Theory.  Now, I would love to research real-life applications
     of Mathematics and Statistics in health sciences. I focus more on the fields of Disease 
     Mapping, Survival Analysis, Spatial-Temporal Analysis/Survival Analysis, Study Design, 
     and Multi-Omics with or without Longitudinal Analysis. For more details about my research, 
     please check my CV</p>
